Links, where I found useful information to perform A1:

* [Sort array](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp)
* [Add axis labels](http://www.d3noob.org/2012/12/adding-axis-labels-to-d3js-graph.html)
* [Add axis labels-2](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/custom_axis.html)
* In [JS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh) I have learnt initial steps for working in VS, setting folder etc

However, during adding axes and labels to them and playing with parameters and attributes, I have noticed, that some lines of code do not make a difference, therefore I deleted them, thus some redundant code from sources is missing in my __vis.js__ file. Of course I have also checked the tutorial, provided on the course webpage.

__vis.js__ file had some self-explanation about what I was doing and motivation of doing so, therefore I just take it from there:
1. Set dimensions
2. Create a variable for the SVG
3. Loading data and processing it (transform to numbers and dividing by million, so it is easier to percept information)
4. Scale and add bars as _rect_
5. Adding axes ans labels

Styling for some elements can be found in external __style.css__ file. __Index.html__ created by template, calling _!_. It links to JS and styles files.
